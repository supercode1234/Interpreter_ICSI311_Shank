# Interpreter_ISCI311_Shank

## Description
This is my assignment for ICSI311-Principles of Programming Lnaugages at UAlbany during Spring 2023.
This is an interpreter for a programming language called Shank.
It has some flaws, but this is what I turned in at the end. 

## How to run
Shank.java is the execution file. Download the files and run them with your IDE. 
You can write some commands in Shank in the .shank file.
You can comment out the exit(1) in the line that checks for the number of arguments in the Shank.java.
Or you can manually add an argument in your IDE (or other ways you choose).
